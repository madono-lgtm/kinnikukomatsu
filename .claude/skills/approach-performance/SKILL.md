  Use to resolve a performance problem — measure a baseline, locate the
  bottleneck, improve, and re-measure (パフォーマンス改善, 高速化, ボトルネック,

  Measurement-driven; avoid premature optimization.

<Goal>

Resolve a concrete performance problem with measurement, not guesswork.

</Goal>

<Method>

Non-trivial work runs through this spine; do not jump straight to edits:

1. Investigate before asserting — read the relevant code, files, and history
   first.
2. Confirm the real goal — mirror it back instead of designing from
   assumptions. Do not ask what investigation can answer; take the recommended
   default on low-risk details and report it.
3. Co-design one decision at a time — widen to the realistic candidates (not
   just two straw options), present tradeoffs with a recommendation, and let
   the user decide.
4. Align on a plan shaped backward from the goal at fixed granularity:
   Goal (acceptance criteria — how we know it is done) → sub-goals (each an
   independently verifiable, reviewable-PR-sized increment) → steps
   (commit-sized edit→verify moves). A sub-goal whose verification cannot be
   stated needs further decomposition. Persist durable or cross-session plans
   in the project's issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues), not local TODO files.
5. Hand off to execution: register the agreed plan as todos shaped
   `Phase{N}.{m} - <task> (executor)` — Phase is the dependency wave, {m} a
   reference id within the phase (no ordering implied), executor one of
   main | worker | reviewer | verifier | debugger | ui-review (default
   main — the primary agent itself; worker only for mechanical work,
   subagents via the Agent tool) — then execute in phase order. The todos
   are the session's execution queue; the plan record holds the durable plan.
6. Execute in small reversible verified steps; checkpoint before anything
   irreversible.
7. Close the loop — summarize what changed and what remains.

</Method>

<Questioning>

Questions to the user must be answerable in ~30 seconds without opening code:

- Never make a bare file/line reference the subject of a question; summarize
  what that code does in plain language first.
- One question = one decision: context summary in the user's terms (what is
  at stake, why decide now) + options phrased as behavior/outcomes, not
  implementation details + a recommended default.
- If answering would require the user to read code, the question is not
  ready — investigate yourself and present conclusions as options.
- Non-blocking details: proceed on the recommended default and report it.

</Questioning>

<AntiPatterns>

- Do not optimize without a target metric and a failing baseline.
- Do not guess the bottleneck; measure before changing code.
- Do not trade correctness or readability for speed without confirming the gain
  is real and worth it.
- Do not declare faster based on a single run; re-measure and watch for
  variance and regressions elsewhere.

</AntiPatterns>

<Steps>

1. Define the target: what metric matters (latency, throughput, memory, p99),
   what the current number is, and what "good enough" is. Confirm the user's
   real constraint before optimizing.
2. Measure a baseline: capture the current metric under realistic conditions
   (representative input/load, warm caches, repeated runs). Record how you
   measured so it is repeatable.
3. Locate the bottleneck: profile to find where time/resources actually go, not
   where they feel like they go. Rank candidates by impact. This read-only
   diagnosis can be delegated to the `debugger` subagent (via the Agent tool)
   when the profiling is involved or the cause is disputed.
4. Form one hypothesis and improve: pick the highest-impact bottleneck, make
   the smallest change aimed at it, and keep behavior correct. Prefer doing
   less work (cache, batch, skip, precompute) and algorithmic wins over
   micro-optimizations.
5. Re-measure: compare against the baseline with the same method. Confirm the
   gain is real, not noise, and that correctness is unchanged (tests still
   pass).
6. Iterate or stop: if the target is met, stop. If not, repeat from step 3 on
   the next bottleneck. Avoid gold-plating past the agreed target.
7. Close the loop: report before/after numbers, the method, and any tradeoffs
   (complexity, memory, readability) accepted.

<Gates>

- [ ] Target metric and threshold agreed before optimizing.
- [ ] Repeatable baseline captured under realistic conditions.
- [ ] Bottleneck chosen by measurement, ranked by impact.
- [ ] Improvement re-measured against the baseline; gain is real, not noise.
- [ ] Correctness unchanged (tests pass); tradeoffs made explicit.
